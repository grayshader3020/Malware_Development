# Malware_Development

# Introduction
This repository demonstrates how to create a simple malware with windows  APIs  and C/C++ programming. 

This repository has two basic practices to design a malware for x86 Windows system 
1. self-injection
2. process-injection

# Sturcture 
The code uses 5 windows APIs  which make our functionality for injection technique:

     1. vitualalloc : to allocate memory 
     
     2. RtlCopyMemory: to read and write in allocated memory space
     
     3. CreateThread: for use of multithreading and concurrency
     
     4. WaitForSingleObject: execution to be held until the thread returns and shell code is executed
     
     5. VirtualFree:to release allocated memory
     
  # Usage 

    1. clone the repo using the follwing command 
           1. git clone https://github.com/grayshader3020/Malware_Development.git
            
     2. Navigate to the directory
           2. cd  Malware_Development

    3. run the desired attack on sandboxed system  compile it first
           g++ -o output_file_name desired attack.cpp

    4. Execute the compiled program
          ./executablefile.exe
